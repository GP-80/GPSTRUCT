    "## 📜 **Section 1: A Brief History of Finding Our Way**\n",
    "\n",
    "How did we get from dusty old maps 🗺️ to pinpoint global accuracy? The journey of satellite navigation is quite a story! Grab some popcorn 🍿 and let's dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **The Spark: Sputnik & Doppler Shift**\n",
    "\n",
    "It all started, perhaps unexpectedly, with the launch of **Sputnik 1** 🛰️ by the Soviet Union in 1957. As this first artificial satellite beeped its way around the globe, scientists at Johns Hopkins University noticed something fascinating: the frequency of Sputnik's radio signal changed as it moved towards or away from them. This is the **Doppler Effect** (or Doppler Shift) – think of how an ambulance siren 🚑 sounds higher pitched coming towards you and lower going away.\n",
    "\n",
    "They realized they could use this shift to track Sputnik's orbit precisely. Then came the *aha!* moment ✨: if you know the satellite's exact orbit, you can flip the problem! A receiver on the ground listening to the signals could figure out its *own* location relative to the known position of the satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚢 **The Pioneer: TRANSIT**\n",
    "\n",
    "This brilliant idea led the US Navy to develop the first operational satellite navigation system: **TRANSIT** (also known as NAVSAT). Launched in the early 1960s and operational by 1964, TRANSIT was a game-changer, especially for submarines 🌊 and ships needing accurate location updates at sea. However, it wasn't quite the real-time system we know today:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ⏳ **Slow Fixes:** You could only get a position fix roughly once an hour when a satellite passed favorably overhead.\n",
    "*   🧍 **Hold Still!** The system worked best if the user wasn't moving too quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, TRANSIT proved the concept worked and set the stage for the global systems to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🇺🇸🇷🇺 Going Global: The Rise of GPS & GLONASS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for 24/7, real-time positioning anywhere on Earth 🌍 drove the development of the first truly *global* systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **GPS (Global Positioning System - USA):** Initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1973, GPS aimed to provide reliable positioning for military purposes 🎖️. The first satellite launched in 1978, and the system reached **Full Operational Capability (FOC)** with 24 satellites in 1995.\n",
    "    *   🔓 **Civilian Access & SA:** While available for civilian use, GPS accuracy was initially limited by **Selective Availability (SA)** – intentional errors introduced for security reasons. Thankfully, SA was switched off in 2000, dramatically improving accuracy for everyone! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema - Russia):** Developed concurrently by the Soviet Union (starting 1976), GLONASS also aimed for global coverage. It launched its first satellite in 1982 and completed its constellation around 1995.\n",
    "    *   🔄 **Revival:** Economic challenges led to a decline in the constellation, but Russia successfully restored GLONASS to full global capability by 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🇪🇺🇨🇳 The Modern Era: Galileo & BeiDou Join the Stage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing the strategic and economic importance of satellite navigation, Europe and China developed their own independent global systems, adding more options and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Galileo (European Union):** A civilian-controlled system  civilians designed for high accuracy and reliability. Initiated in 1999, it began offering services in 2016 and has since reached FOC. A key feature is its **interoperability** with GPS – meaning receivers can use signals from both systems seamlessly, boosting performance.🤝\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **BeiDou (BDS - China):** Evolving from a regional system (BeiDou-1), China completed its global BeiDou-3 constellation in 2020. It includes satellites in different orbit types (MEO, GEO, IGSO - more on that later!) and is also designed to be interoperable with other GNSS like GPS and Galileo. 🤝\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛰️➕ **Enhancing Accuracy: Regional & Augmentation Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the global players, other systems help refine our position:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **RNSS (Regional Systems):** Provide independent navigation over specific areas, like Japan's **QZSS** (which also boosts GPS over East Asia/Oceania 🇯🇵) and India's **NavIC** (covering India and surrounding regions 🇮🇳).\n",
    "*   **SBAS (Augmentation Systems):** These clever systems don't navigate on their own but broadcast correction messages (often from **geostationary** satellites – ones that stay fixed above the equator 🛰️). These corrections improve the accuracy and reliability (**integrity**) of signals from the main GNSS constellations. Think of them as helpful guides whispering corrections to your receiver! Examples include WAAS (USA 🇺🇸), EGNOS (Europe 🇪🇺), MSAS (Japan 🇯🇵), and GAGAN (India 🇮🇳).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **Today: A World of Multi-GNSS**\n",
    "\n",
    "We now live in a vibrant **multi-GNSS** era! 🥳 Modern receivers often listen to signals from GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou *simultaneously*. Why is this awesome?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   👀 **More Satellites Visible:** Better chance of seeing the minimum 4 satellites needed for a 3D fix.\n",
    "*   🎯 **Improved Accuracy:** More signals = more data = potentially better position calculation.\n",
    "*   💪 **Increased Reliability:** Less likely to lose signal completely if one system is blocked or unavailable.\n",
    "*   🏙️ **Better Performance:** Especially noticeable in tricky environments like deep city canyons or mountain valleys where the view of the sky is limited.\n",

    "## 💫 **Section 2: Charting the Heavens - Satellite Orbits & TLEs**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do these GNSS satellites stay up there 🛰️, and how do we know *exactly* where they are? 🤔 Let's explore the fascinating world of satellite orbits and the special data format we use to track them: TLEs!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌌 **Orbits: The Highways in the Sky**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most GNSS satellites, including the stars of our show (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou), zoom around Earth in **Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)**. Picture MEO as a busy orbital highway 🛣️ located roughly 20,000 kilometers (about 12,500 miles) above us – way higher than the International Space Station (ISS) 🧑‍🚀, but much closer than those geostationary satellites that seem to hang still in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why MEO? It's a sweet spot 🎯:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   🌍 **Global Coverage:** High enough that a constellation of 24-30 satellites can blanket almost the entire globe.\n",
    "*   📶 **Signal Strength:** Close enough that their signals reach our receivers on the ground without needing ridiculously powerful transmitters.\n",
    "*   ⏱️ **Orbital Period:** They typically circle Earth about twice a day (periods of 11-14 hours). This constant movement means different satellites are always coming into view from any location, ensuring you can usually \"see\" enough of them for a position fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these satellites for navigation, knowing their *precise* location at *any given moment* is absolutely critical! 📍\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 **TLEs: The Satellite Position Cheat Sheet**\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we get this vital location information? One very common method uses **Two-Line Element (TLE)** sets. Originally cooked up by NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) and now maintained by the U.S. Space Force 🇺🇸, a TLE is a super-compact format that crams a ton of info about a satellite's orbit into just two lines of text (plus a title line).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a TLE as a snapshot 📸 of the satellite's orbital recipe at a specific time, called the **epoch**. Here’s a peek at what those lines tell us:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Line 0 (Title):** The satellite's common name (e.g., \"GPS BIIF-12 (PRN 32)\").\n",
    "*   **Line 1:** Satellite ID, classification (military/civilian), launch details, the **epoch** (the exact timestamp 📅 the data was valid for), and terms describing how the orbit is slowly changing (due to drag, etc.).\n",
    "*   **Line 2:** The orbital mechanics goldmine! ✨\n",
    "        📐 **Inclination (i):** The tilt angle of the orbit relative to Earth's equator.\n",
    "        🌍 **Right Ascension of the Ascending Node (RAAN or Ω):** Where the orbit crosses the equator going north (longitude of the crossing point).\n",
    "        𖦹 **Eccentricity (e):** How stretched out the orbit is (0 = perfect circle, <1 = ellipse).\n",
    "        📍 **Argument of Perigee (ω):** Where the orbit's lowest point (perigee) is located within the orbital plane.\n",
    "        🔄 **Mean Anomaly (M):** An angle showing where the satellite was along its orbit *at the epoch*, assuming a simple circular path.\n",
    "        💨 **Mean Motion (n):** How many orbits the satellite completes per day (related to its speed).\n",
    "        ✅ Plus revolution number and data checksums .\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Important Note:** TLEs use *mean* elements, averaged out using specific mathematical models (like **SGP4**). These models predict the orbit by accounting for the main forces acting on the satellite (Earth's gravity, atmospheric drag 🌬️, pulls from the Sun ☀️ and Moon 🌕). They give a pretty good approximation, especially for visualization, but for super high-precision work, scientists use more detailed data formats (like precise ephemerides).\n",
    "\n",
    "Software like the `skyfield` library we're using is smart enough 🧠 to read TLEs and use the SGP4 model to predict a satellite's position at times *other* than the epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**❓ Where to find TLEs?** Good public sources include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   🔗 [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/): A very popular source, great for publicly available data (and the one we'll use!).\n",
    "*   🔗 [Space-Track.org](https://www.space-track.org/): The official source (requires registration).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 **Setting Up Our Tools: Importing Libraries**\n",

    "## 💨⚡️ Section 3: The Atmospheric Gauntlet - Signal Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a GNSS signal as a tiny messenger 📨 traveling thousands of kilometers from a satellite to your receiver. It's an incredible journey, but it's not always smooth sailing! ⛵ As the signal punches through Earth's atmosphere, it encounters obstacles that can slow it down or disrupt it, potentially causing errors 😵 in your calculated position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main atmospheric layers acting as hurdles are the **Troposphere** and the **Ionosphere**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌦️ Hurdle 1: The Troposphere (Weather Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **📍 Where is it?** This is the dense layer closest to Earth, stretching from the surface up to about 8-16 km (5-10 miles). It's where our weather happens ☔☀️☁️, containing most of the atmosphere's air, water vapor, and dust.\n",
    "*   **🚧 The Challenge: Signal Delay (Refraction):** Just like light bending when it enters water 💧, radio signals bend and slow down when they move from the vacuum of space into the denser troposphere. This bending is called **refraction**. The amount of delay depends on:\n",
    "    *   🌡️ Atmospheric conditions: Air pressure, temperature, and especially **humidity** (water vapor content).\n",
    "    *   📐 Satellite Angle: Signals from satellites lower on the horizon travel through *more* troposphere, experiencing greater delay.\n",
    "*   **📉 Impact:** This delay adds extra travel time to the signal, making the satellite seem farther away than it is. The error is typically 2-3 meters for satellites directly overhead (at **zenith**) but can swell to over 20 meters for satellites near the horizon! 😱 While this delay affects all GNSS frequencies similarly (it's *not* frequency-dependent), accurate positioning requires sophisticated models 🧠 to estimate and correct for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Hurdle 2: The Ionosphere (Charged Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **📍 Where is it?** Located above the troposphere, from about 60 km up to 1000 km or more. Here, the sun's intense radiation ☀️ strips electrons from atoms, creating a layer of electrically charged particles (ions and free electrons) – a plasma! ⚡\n",
    "*   **🚧 The Challenges:** This charged environment poses two main problems for GNSS signals:\n",
    "    1.  **⏳ Frequency-Dependent Delay:** The free electrons interact with the radio waves, causing a significant delay. Crucially, this delay *depends on the signal's frequency*. Lower frequencies are delayed *more* than higher frequencies (the delay is proportional to 1/frequency²). This is the single biggest error source for basic, single-frequency GNSS receivers.\n",
    "    2.  **💥 Scintillation (Signal Sparkle):** Irregularities and turbulence within the ionosphere's plasma can cause the satellite signal's strength (amplitude) and phase to fluctuate rapidly. Imagine looking at a star through turbulent air – it appears to twinkle ⭐. This \"twinkling\" effect for radio waves is called **scintillation**. Severe scintillation can make it difficult for a receiver to track the signal, sometimes even causing a complete loss of lock! 🚫🛰️\n",
    "*   **💥 Impact & Mitigation:** Ionospheric delay can be HUGE – tens of meters, sometimes over 100 meters! 📏 Its magnitude varies greatly with time of day 🕒 (worse in the afternoon/evening), location 🌍 (worse near the equator), the 11-year solar cycle ☀️, and satellite angle 📐. However, its frequency dependence is the key! 🔑 By comparing the arrival times of signals sent on *two different frequencies* (like the L1 and L2/L5 signals used by modern GNSS), clever **dual-frequency receivers** 📡📡 can very accurately measure and remove almost all of the ionospheric delay. Phew! ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Visualizing the Invisible: Atmospheric Layers in Our Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "In our upcoming visualization 📊, we want to show where the Troposphere and Ionosphere sit relative to the Earth and the satellite orbits. However, plotting them to their *actual* scale would make them practically invisible 🐜 compared to the vast distances to the satellites!\n",
    "\n",
    "To make them visible and appreciate their position, we'll use a common visualization trick: **exaggerating their thickness** using **scale factors** 📏➡️🐘. We'll draw the upper boundary of each layer much farther out than it really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Troposphere:** We'll use a large scale factor (e.g., 150x) to make this thin layer clearly visible near the Earth's surface.\n",
    "*   **Ionosphere:** We'll use a smaller, but still significant, scale factor (e.g., 15x) to show its vast extent above the troposphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚨 Remember:** When you see these layers in the plot, keep in mind their depicted thickness is **NOT realistic** – it's purely for visual clarity! We'll define the specific layers, their representative upper altitudes for plotting, and their scale factors in the next code cell. 👇\n"

    "## 📊✨ Section 4: Let's Visualize! Bringing GNSS to Life\n",
    "\n",
    "Theory is great 🤓, but seeing is believing! 👀 Now, we'll harness the power of Python and Plotly to create an interactive 2D visualization of the GNSS environment we've been discussing. Let's paint a picture! 🖼️\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎬 Step 1: Setting the Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start drawing, we need to prepare our digital canvas and gather some basic ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ⏱️ **Time Check:** We'll use `skyfield` to grab the current time (`ts.now()`). While our plot is a static snapshot 📸, knowing the current time is fundamental for real-world GNSS calculations where satellite positions constantly change based on their TLE data and the current moment.\n",
    "*   🖼️ **Figure Foundation:** We create an empty `go.Figure` object from Plotly. This is like our blank canvas where we'll add all the visual elements (Earth, layers, orbits, satellites) one by one.\n",
    "*   📏 **Earthly Dimensions:** We define Earth's average radius (`earth_r`) in kilometers (approx. 6371 km). We also create a range of angles (`theta`) using NumPy, covering a full circle (0 to 2π radians). These angles are essential for calculating the (x, y) points needed to draw circles using `cos(theta)` and `sin(theta)`.\n",
    "*   📐 **Keeping Boundaries:** We initialize a variable `max_radius`. As we add orbits and scaled atmospheric layers, we'll keep track of the largest radius drawn. This helps us set the plot's boundaries later, ensuring nothing gets cut off at the edges.\n"

    "Next up, let's draw the Troposphere 🌦️ and Ionosphere ✨. Remember our scaling trick to make them visible? Here’s how we apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **🔄 Loop Through Layers:** We process our `layers` list (in reverse order ⏪, so the outer Ionosphere is drawn first, appearing *underneath* the Troposphere).\n",
    "2.  **✖️ Grab the Scale Factor:** For each layer, we get its specific visual exaggeration factor from our `scale_factors` dictionary.\n",
    "3.  **📏 Calculate Visual Radius:** We determine the radius for the *drawing* by adding the layer's (scaled) height to Earth's radius: `display_r = earth_r + real_height * scale_factor`. This puffs them up! 🎈\n",
    "4.  **✍️ Craft Hover Info:** We create detailed pop-up text (using HTML `<br>` for line breaks and `<b>` for bold) that appears when you hover your mouse🖱️ over the layer. This includes:\n",
    "    *   Layer Name (e.g., **Troposphere**)\n",
    "    *   Actual Altitude Range (e.g., 0 - ~16 km)\n",
    "    *   Visualized Edge Altitude (e.g., 12 km - the value used *before* scaling)\n",
    "    *   Brief Description (e.g., Contains most air and weather)\n",
    "    *   GNSS Effect (e.g., Signal delay due to water vapor)\n",
    "    *   Visual Scale Factor Applied (e.g., 150x 🤯)\n",
    "5.  **🖌️ Draw the Layer (Scatter Trace):** We add a `go.Scatter` trace to our figure for each layer:\n",
    "    *   `x` & `y`: Calculated using the `display_r` and our `theta` angles to form a circle ⭕.\n",
    "    *   `mode='lines'`: Draws the circle's outline.\n",
    "    *   `fill='toself'`: Fills the circle with color, starting from the line and going towards the center (0,0).\n",
    "    *   `fillcolor` & `line`: Use the layer's defined semi-transparent color (RGBA allows transparency!).\n",
    "    *   `text`: Assigns our carefully crafted hover information string.\n",
    "    *   `hoverinfo='text'`: Tells Plotly to show *only* the content from our `text` attribute on hover.\n",
    "    *   `showlegend=False`: Keeps the layers out of the main plot legend (which is reserved for constellations).\n",
    "6.  **🏷️ Add Label (Annotation):** We add a text label (`go.Annotation`) near the edge of each layer circle using `fig.add_annotation`. This makes it easy to identify the layers directly on the plot without needing to hover.\n"

    "### 🛰️🛰️🛰️ Step 4: Populating the Orbits with Satellites\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the main event – plotting the actual GNSS satellites and their orbital paths! 🌟 This is where the sky really comes alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We loop through each constellation (GPS, GLONASS, etc.) defined in our `sources` dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  📥 **Fetch Latest Data:** Use `skyfield.load.tle_file(url, reload=True)` to download the most recent TLE data for the constellation from CelesTrak. `reload=True` is crucial for getting up-to-date info! 🔄 We wrap this in error handling (`try...except`) just in case the download fails (network glitch? 🌐❌).\n",
    "2.  ⭕ **Define Orbit Circle:** Calculate the radius `R` for the constellation's *simplified circular orbit* based on its nominal altitude (`R = earth_r + alt`). We also update `max_radius` if this orbit is the largest yet, ensuring our plot boundaries are big enough.\n",
    "3.  〰️ **Draw Orbit Path:** Add a `go.Scatter` trace to draw the circular orbit line using the calculated radius `R` and the constellation's assigned color 🎨. We use `hoverinfo=\\'skip\\'` because we want the hover details on the satellites, not the orbit line itself.\n",
    "4.  📍 **Plot Individual Satellites:** This is where we place the markers for each satellite:\n",
    "    *   **🛰️ Loop Through Sats:** Iterate through every satellite (`sat`) loaded from the TLE file for the current constellation.\n",
    "    *   **📐 Simplified Positioning:** For this 2D view, we use a shortcut! We take the **Mean Anomaly (M)** from the TLE (`sat.model.mo`) – which represents the satellite's position *if* it were in a perfect circle – convert it to an angle, and use `cos` and `sin` with the orbit radius `R` to get its (x, y) coordinates. \n",
    "        *   *⚠️ Simplification Alert!* Real orbits are elliptical, and finding the precise position (True Anomaly) requires more complex calculations (solving Kepler's Equation). But for visualization, Mean Anomaly gives a good-enough spread around the circle.\n",
    "    *   **📝 Gather Hover Data:** For each satellite, we extract key orbital elements from its TLE model (`sat.model`) and format them nicely using f-strings. This data will appear in the hover tooltip 🖱️:\n",
    "        *   Inclination (i)\n",
    "        *   Eccentricity (e)\n",
    "        *   Epoch (The exact time the TLE data is valid for 📅)\n",
    "        *   RAAN (Ω)\n",
    "        *   Argument of Perigee (ω)\n",
    "        *   Mean Anomaly (M)\n",
    "    *   **💾 Store Data:** We collect the calculated coordinates (`xs`, `ys`), satellite names (`labels`), and the formatted orbital elements (`custom`) in Python lists.\n",
    "5.  ✨ **Draw Satellite Markers:** Add *another* `go.Scatter` trace specifically for the satellite markers of the current constellation:\n",
    "    *   `mode=\\'markers\\'`: Tells Plotly to draw points instead of lines.\n",
    "    *   `marker`: Defines the style (small, semi-transparent circles with colored outlines matching the constellation).\n",
    "    *   `name`: Sets the constellation name (e.g., 'GPS') so it appears correctly in the legend.\n",
    "    *   `hovertemplate`: Creates the custom hover text using HTML (`<br>`, `<b>`) and special Plotly variables (`%{text}` for the satellite name, `%{customdata[index]}` for accessing our collected orbital elements). `<extra></extra>` hides the default trace info.\n",
    "    *   `text` & `customdata`: Provide the lists of names and orbital elements we gathered, linking the data to each marker.\n"
